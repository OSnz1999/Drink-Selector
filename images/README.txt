Place your drink bottle photos in this folder.

Example:
- jack-daniels.jpg
- bombay-sapphire.png

Then, in the web app Admin area:
- When adding or editing a drink, type just the file name (e.g. jack-daniels.jpg) into the Image File box.
- The app will automatically use /images/<file-name> as the image path.
